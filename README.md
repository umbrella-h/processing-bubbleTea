-----Description-----

An Interactive BubbleTea game.(For my mom's appetite :))

Bubbles moving back and forth,
with a random starting position, speed, color for each bubble.

The canvas size is responsive to the browser window size,
while the radius and speed for each bubble are only related to the window size in the beginning.

-----Interaction-----

1) window size: Your tea cup is resizable!!!

2) keyboard: 'z'/ 'x' for the size of the bubbles and the straw.
             UP/ DOWN for the speed of the bubbles.
             
2) mouse: 'Press' for catching bubbles.Catching multiple bubbles at the same time is enabled.
          Once a bubble is catched, the bubble deforms with its color changed.
          'Drag' for moving the catched bubbles around.
          
3) AudioInput: While keeping the mouse pressed,
               make some long sound near your microphone to eat the bubbles!!!
               The Louder, the faster!
